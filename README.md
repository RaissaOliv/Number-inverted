# Number-inverted
A program that checks if a number is the same after being inverted

**********
Number inverted is a code made with javascript/html! It's concept is pretty simple: The user puts a random number on the input and the program checks if the number stays the same after inverting their positions (for example: 2001 inverted is 1002. Therefore, it's not the same. On the other side, 2002 after being inverted is still 2002).
